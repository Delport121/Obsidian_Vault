#Python_F1tenth #Local_planning
This code defines a class named `LocalReference`, which is responsible for handling local reference path-related computations and plotting. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. **Imports**:
    - `numpy` (as `np`): Numerical Python library for array manipulation and mathematical operations.
    - `matplotlib.pyplot` (as `plt`): Plotting library for creating visualizations.
    - `casadi` (as `ca`): A symbolic framework for numerical optimization and algorithm development.
    - `trajectory_planning_helpers as tph`: This imports a module or package named `trajectory_planning_helpers` and aliases it as `tph`. This module likely contains helper functions related to trajectory planning.

2. **Class Definition - `LocalReference`**:
    - The `__init__` method initializes the `LocalReference` object with the provided `local_map` object.
    - It extracts various attributes from the `local_map` object such as the track path, track length, elemental lengths, track coordinates, and normal vectors.
    - It then sets up interpolation functions (`lut_x` and `lut_y`) for the center path, left path, and right path using B-spline interpolation.
    - There's also a method `calculate_s` to calculate the arc length `s` along the path from a given point.
    - Another method `interp_pts` is used for interpolating points along the path.
    - The `plot_path` method plots the center path, left path, and right path.
    - The `plot_angles` method plots the fixed angles along the path.

3. **Main Section**:
    - If the script is executed directly (i.e., not imported as a module), it creates an instance of `LocalReference` class with a placeholder argument `"aut"`.
    - It then calls the `plot_path` and `plot_angles` methods to visualize the path and angles.
    - Finally, it prints the value of `center_lut_x` at a specific position along the path (`s = 120`).

Overall, this code encapsulates functionality related to handling and visualizing local reference paths for trajectory planning. It utilizes CasADi for efficient symbolic interpolation and NumPy/Matplotlib for numerical computation and visualization, respectively.
