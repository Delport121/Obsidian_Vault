#Python_F1tenth #Local_planning
This code appears to be a Python script for generating local maps from input scan data, possibly obtained from sensors like LiDAR or radar, typically used in autonomous driving or robotics applications. Let's break down the main components and functionalities of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The script begins by importing necessary libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations, SciPy for scientific computing functions, and a module named `trajectory_planning_helpers` for additional helper functions.

2. **Constants**: Several constants are defined such as `DISTNACE_THRESHOLD`, `TRACK_WIDTH`, `FOV` (Field of View), etc., which are used throughout the script.

3. **Class Definition - LocalMapGenerator**: 
    - The class `LocalMapGenerator` is defined, which presumably encapsulates functionalities related to generating local maps.
    - The constructor (`__init__`) initializes parameters and variables including angles, z transform, and paths for saving data if required.
    - Methods within the class are designed for specific tasks related to processing scan data and generating local maps.

4. **Main Methods**:
    - `generate_line_local_map`: This method takes a scan as input, extracts track boundaries, calculates visible segments, estimates semi-visible segments, and regularizes the track to generate a local map. It also saves the generated data if required.
    - `extract_track_boundaries`: This method processes the scan data to extract left and right track boundaries.
    - `calculate_visible_segments` and `estimate_semi_visible_segments`: These methods determine visible and semi-visible segments of the track respectively.
    - `regularise_track`: Regularizes the track boundaries and generates a local map.
  
5. **Helper Functions**: Several helper functions are defined to perform specific tasks like interpolating tracks, resampling track points, calculating boundary segments, extending boundary lines, calculating normal vectors, ensuring path existence, etc.

6. **`if __name__ == "__main__":` Block**: This block ensures that the script's main functionality is not executed when the script is imported as a module.

Overall, this script seems to be part of a larger system for processing sensor data and generating local maps for autonomous navigation or similar applications. It involves a combination of numerical computation, interpolation, and geometric calculations to extract meaningful information from sensor readings.
