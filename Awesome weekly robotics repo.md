This document serve more as a checklist for myself regarding the repo. Only the really useful and relevant ones are listed
# Open source robots
### Rovers and cars

- Turtlebot: Is great for learning the basics of ros and how it works. I uses the SLAM toolbox aswell as nav2.
- Donkeycar: This is a learning platform that uses python. It has lots of things regarding computers vision and neural networks
- linorobot: Modular learning platform that utilises a teensy and ros
- MuSHR: This is a evolution of the F1tenth car. This might really be worth looking into
- Makers's Pet: Micro Ros on a ESP32
- Race_stack: Forza ETH-racestack
- Duckietown: Probably the leaders when it comes to vision and autonomous driving Good resources

```python
arr1[]
arr2[]
arr3[]

for i in range(length(arr1))
	arr3[i]=arr2[i]+arr1[i]

for i, arr1 in enumerate(arr1)
	arr1 = arr1 +i
```
