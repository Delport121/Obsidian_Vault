1. *CD-ROM Repository Error:*
The error Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs indicates that the CD-ROM repository is causing problems.

To remove the CD-ROM repository from your sources list, you can edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

sh
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Look for lines that start with deb cdrom: and comment them out by adding a # at the beginning of each line.

Save the file and exit (Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit in nano).

2. *ROS Repository Error:*
The error 404 Not Found [IP: 64.50.236.52 80] for the ROS repository suggests that the repository URL is incorrect or the repository is not available.

You might need to update the repository URL or remove it. You can do this by editing the appropriate list file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. Look for a file that includes ros in its name and update or comment out the problematic line:

sh
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list
Comment out the line with the ROS repository or update it if you have the correct URL.

* There is both version of this for ros1 and ros2. I accessed the ros1 indicated here and commented the line which fix the issue.

3. *MikTeX Architecture Warning:*
The warning about universe/binary-i386/Packages indicates that the MikTeX repository does not support the i386 architecture. If you're not using i386 packages, you can safely ignore this warning. If you want to remove this repository, you can edit the corresponding list file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/.

After making these changes, run the following commands to update your package lists again:
