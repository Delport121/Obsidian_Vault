# DAILY NOTE
### *Wednesday, August 21st, 2024*

## Ongoing Tasks

- [x] Experiment with the Kalman filter SLAM
	- [x] Actually just studies it for true understanding
- [ ] Study up the SLAM section in probabilistic robotics
- [ ] Dart through SLAM lectures for understanding the integration into a coding environment.
- [ ] 
- [ ] Organise coffee with Aiden
- [ ] Try mapping the whole lab
- [ ] 3D lidar in Rviz and IMU, Another dynamic model
- [ ] 3D Feature extraction
- [ ] Bursary application
- [ ] Rtabmap and orbslam
	- [ ] Perhaps use curve fitting instead of splines? 
	- [ ] Added less angular uncertainty since turn angle will be small
	- [ ] Added box lidar for better scanning
	- [ ] Used rangelib library for faster computing
- [x] Investigated scan matching to figure out where it would be used in localisation algorithms
	- It generally has a wide application, but is decoupled from a particle filter
	- It can however be used as a pre-correction step for uncertainties in odometry or the motion model. 
	- Could almost be considered an alternative motion model
	- It can also be used to update weights in the particle filter if 
	- Some SLAM algorithms are built on top of it
- [x] Note on common SLAM algorithms
	- Filtering based:
		- Uses EKF of particle filter for state estimation and building the map based on state estimation
		-  Examples: Gmapping, Hector SLAM
		- Filtering still cannot provide the ground truth, thus it struggles with large environments or when dead-reckoning is not good
	- Graph-based
		- Uses pose graphs to store constraints between pose estimations
		- Optimisation for loop closure to correct pose estimations
			- Examples: KartoSlam, Cartographer, Slam-toolbox
