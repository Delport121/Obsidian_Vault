# DAILY NOTE
### *Wednesday, August 21st, 2024*

## Ongoing Tasks

- [x] Experiment with the Kalman filter SLAM
	- [x] Actually just studies it for true understanding
- [x] Investigated scan matching to figure out where it would be used in localisation algorithms
	- It generally has a wide application, but is decoupled from a particle filter
	- Scan matching entails more than just matching LIDAR scans, as features can also be used
	- It can however be used as a pre-correction step for uncertainties in odometry or the motion model. 
	- Could almost be considered an alternative motion model and can be used instead of traditional motion models
	- It can also be used to update weights in the particle filter
	- It is more explicitly used in SLAM for map building (scan-to-scan)
	- The method can be used to match the scan to the given map (scan-to-map)
- [x] Note on common SLAM algorithms
	- Filtering based:
		- Uses EKF of particle filter for state estimation and building the map based on state estimation
		-  Examples: Gmapping, Hector SLAM
		- Filtering still cannot provide the ground truth, thus it struggles with large environments or when dead-reckoning is not good
	- Graph-based
		- Uses pose graphs to store constraints between pose estimations
		- Optimisation for loop closure to correct pose estimations
			- Examples: KartoSlam, Cartographer, Slam-toolbox
