# DAILY NOTE
### *Tuesday, August 20th, 2024*

## Ongoing Tasks
- [x] Finished localisation chapter in probabilistic robotics
- [x] Investigated combining the particle filter with the EKF, since the EKF is a featured based mapping approach. 
	- Realised that the particle filter is the superior one in most instances and it can be modified to use features as well
- [x] Focused on understanding the how the covariance and features a represented in graph to display the working of the algorithms
