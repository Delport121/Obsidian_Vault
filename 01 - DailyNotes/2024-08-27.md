## Ongoing Tasks

- [ ] Study up the SLAM section in probabilistic robotics
- [ ] Dart through SLAM lectures for understanding the integration into a coding environment.
- [ ] Organise coffee with Aiden
- [ ] Try mapping the whole lab
- [ ] 3D lidar in Rviz and IMU, Another dynamic model
- [ ] 3D Feature extraction
- [ ] Bursary application
- [ ] Rtabmap and orbslam
	- [ ] Perhaps use curve fitting instead of splines? 
	- [ ] Added less angular uncertainty since turn angle will be small
	- [ ] Added box lidar for better scanning
	- [ ] Used rangelib library for faster computing\
- [ ] Go through reference in line extraction
- [ ] Check line extraction algorithms
