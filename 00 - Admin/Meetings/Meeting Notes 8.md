## Notes and Questions
So my end goal (for now) is to create the algorithm and test it on F1tenth and other robot?

Autorally implementation?
Papers, should I be worried about this. (Especially to keep my options open)
Discuss thesis outline
Testing metrics and comparisons for the algorithm



## What have I done

- [x] Lectures Thursday and Friday (Its about Kalman filters, hopefully its worthwhile)  [completion:: 2024-04-21]
- [x] Do the assignments in Ben's repo?  [completion:: 2024-04-17]
      Unfortunately not possible since it is incomplete, but the theory remains usefull
- [ ] I am looking to implement simple algorithms of the particle filter and Slam for a fundamental understanding.  I am finding it rather difficult to jump directly into the F1tenh Gym. This may take some time though
- [x] Continue research in regards to where there a gaps in the industry (Such as the fast image processing for racing)  [completion:: 2024-04-22]
	- [x] Look at linkdin saves posts  [completion:: 2024-04-22]
	- [x] Look at bookmarks  [completion:: 2024-04-16]
	- Offroad aggressive racing seem to be relatively new (Utilises racing with images, but requires some beefy computing power)
	- Sydney university is doing research on ground vehicles for sheep 
- [ ] I want to mess with ros more and perhaps take a from scratch approach, so I do not run into issues later on (Lidar etc)
- [x] Setup latex template for note taking aspect of thesis (Remember Altus send something)  [completion:: 2024-04-22]
- [x] Chapter outline for a direction to discuss objectives. This is to brake down the masters into smaller problems  [completion:: 2024-04-23]
- [x] Understand particle filter   [completion:: 2024-04-22]
	- Probalist robotics helped with finally understanding it

What is my contribution? Keep focus
Look on research on autorally, what they do etc

## Plan for next week
- [x] Read a paper or two  [completion:: 2024-05-01]
	- [ ] Magic Formula tyre model
	- [ ] Common Road vehicle
	- [ ] Model- and Acceleration-based Pursuit Controller for  
		High-Performance Autonomous Racing
	- [ ] https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1729881418755245
	- [x] Slam Paper  [completion:: 2024-05-01]
- [x] Continue with SLAM  [completion:: 2024-04-30]
- [x] Finish the rough simulation for understanding  [completion:: 2024-04-30]
- [ ] Later goal
