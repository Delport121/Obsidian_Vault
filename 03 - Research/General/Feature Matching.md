Measurements from the vehicleâ€™s laser scanners are compared (matched) to permanent map references (features) such as walls and pillars. Should part of a site not have enough distinctive features, reflective stickers can also be added to provide additional references.

A key benefit of matching features, rather than laser points, is that features are highly distinctive due to the specific size and angle of each. They are therefore simple for the system to identify and successfully match.

Because the resulting map contains only the coordinates of static, permanent features, it is much smaller in terms of file size than a grid-based map used by scan matching.
