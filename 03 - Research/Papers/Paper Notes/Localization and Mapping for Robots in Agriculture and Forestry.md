[[Localization and Mapping for Robots in Agriculture and Forestry.pdf]]

Various methods of localisation in agriculture and forestry is described. The paper does a very good job of describing SLAM in a simple and concise way and also give information on four different SLAM methods

# Literature review
## Solving the SLAM problem
- EKF SLAM
- Information filter (IF)
- The particle filter (PF)
- Graph-based SLAM
## Mapping the environment
- The data association problem
- Metric maps
- Topological maps
- Semantic maps
- Hybrid maps
## The visual odometry method
This section is a little bit lacking. Need some more insight into this
# Methodology
The approach and classification categories are described
# Localization and mapping in agriculture
A usefull survey table is provided. Will definitely refer back to this
# Localization and mapping in forestry
A similar approach is taken
# Datasets for Localization and Mapping in Agriculture and Forestry
Useful datasets are provided. Might come in handy later
# Conclusion
This study leads to the main conclusion that this research line is
still premature, and many research topics are still open. In particular, 3D localization is quite rare in these environments. Furthermore, advanced mapping techniques that are now present in other areas such as topological and semantic mapping are yet to develop in agriculture and forestry.
