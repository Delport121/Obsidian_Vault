The purpose of following these tuts were to figure out an issue in loading the created SLAM map in articulated robotics's tutorial. 
I used the following:
- https://roboticsbackend.com/ros2-nav2-generate-a-map-with-slam_toolbox/#Next_steps_with_the_generated_map
- https://roboticsbackend.com/ros2-nav2-tutorial/


These tutorial are more straight forward as it uses the turtlebot. 
- Note however that the first link has a early step that required you to configure the DDS. This prevented me from running the nodes later on.  I was still able to do the tutorials without it.
- SImilarly the second tutorial also require the configuration of the DDS at some stage. Ignore this, but do change the differential drive thing as requested
