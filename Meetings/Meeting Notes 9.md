## Notes and Questions

![[Pasted image 20240508103329.png]]
This is Voxgraph repo for from eth zurich. Is this the general idea?

I do not recieve the email for the presentations

Pick up stuuf at acqusitions
## Ben questions
- Ben's thesis?
- Where would you say are they aspects of novelty in my thesis
- Am I heading in the correct direction?
	- Curve regression and then using that for a slam implementation?
- Particle filter testing with Chris
- Re implementing the particle filter: In the simulator and ros?
- "Maximise localisation performance" 
	- The deem the best way would be to compare the accuracy to the actual position, hence why I am thinking that testing with chris would be a good idea/

## What have I done
- [x] Completed the slam implementation of paper  [completion:: 2024-05-01]
	- Required some debugging and tuning since the guy's initial stuff were wrong
- [x] Also studied the accompanying paper for this specific implementation  [completion:: 2024-05-01]
	- 
- [x] Read a paper or two  [completion:: 2024-05-01]
	- [x] https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1729881418755245  [completion:: 2024-05-07]
	- [x] Slam Paper  [completion:: 2024-05-01]
- [x] Implemented the original ros particle filter  [completion:: 2024-05-08]

Thursday:
- Holonics
Friday:
- Demi 
- Pocket cube
- Upgraded PC

Monday
- Printed journal club papers
- Went through F1tenth gym particle filter
- Ros with Iming's pure pursuit and particle filter
- Refresh on Ben's paper and the goal
Tuesday
- Went through MPPC again to see how it was implemented in code
Wednesday
- Edited a bit on latex (Ben's suggestions)


## Plans for next week
- [ ] Reimplement particle filter for F1Tenth racing
	- [ ] Experiment to maximise localisation performance
	- [ ] Recreate sensor model used in https://github.com/f1tenth/particle_filter
	- [ ] Write in JAX libraries
	- [ ] Look at numba library
- [ ] Study 2 papers
	- [ ] Magic Formula tyre model
	- [ ] Common Road vehicle
	- [ ] Model- and Acceleration-based Pursuit Controller for  
		High-Performance Autonomous Racing
	- [ ] https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1729881418755245
	- [x] Slam Paper  [completion:: 2024-05-01]
- [x] Look at how the particle filter of the simulator and the ros simulator  [completion:: 2024-05-08]]
- [ ] Study a bit more on Slam
