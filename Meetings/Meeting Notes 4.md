# Questions
- None
# What have I done:
- Got ros to commmunicate with the simulator and with the car. I had many problems with docker and spent most of my time on trying to figure it out.
- Looked at scan matching lectures from f1tenth
- Roughly touched on slam.
- Stated looking at Ben's code again

# Plan for next week:
- Study state estimation theory
 - Do some research in regards to where there a gaps in the industry (Such as the fast image processing for racing)
 - Maybe add a lidar to the model and look at nav2? (SLAM stuff since this relates to what I have to do)
