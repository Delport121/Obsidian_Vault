# Questions
## Ben
- The race track generator for pure pursuit does not work for the updated simulator. It does not find the minimum curve csv folder. Upon closer inspection it does not seem that there is such a folder in the directory at all.
- MPCC works but requires IPopt. This is mentioned in the readme, but the link takes you to Benjamin's repo.
- I am struggling to run the state estimation folder code. Its missing the file directory yet I am in the correct directory?
- WIll I be able to build and test my algorithms with the simulator (Especially in regards to the visualisation)
# What have I done:
- Looked at CARLA. Seems like a very fancy simulator, but it is not so relevant to what I think ill need. It seems a little to advance for my purposes
- Went through the lectures regarding particle filters, SLAM, state estimation and scan matching.
- Went through Ben's paper again. My understanding of it is a bit better now. It allows me to understand the code a bit better.
- Look at state estimation theory. There is still a lot of detail but I understand the basic idea of it.
- Studied some of Ben's code in conjunction with reading the paper.

# Plan for next week:
- Study state estimation theory
 - Do some research in regards to where there a gaps in the industry (Such as the fast image processing for racing)
 - Maybe add a lidar to the model and look at nav2? (SLAM stuff since this relates to what I have to do)

Slam for ros
What is my contribution? Keep focus
Dont try to recode, only if necessary
Plan for benjamins questions, so he can
