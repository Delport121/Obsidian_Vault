# Questions
- The race track generator for pure pursuit does not work for the updated simulator. It does not find the minimum curve csv folder. Upon closer inspection it does not seem that there is such a folder in the directory at all.
- MPCC works but requires IPopt. This is mentioned in the readme, but the link takes you to the benjamins repo.
# What have I done:
- Looked at CARLA. Seems like a very fancy simulator, but it is not so relevant to what I think ill need. It seems a little to advance for my purposes

# Plan for next week:
- Study state estimation theory
 - Do some research in regards to where there a gaps in the industry (Such as the fast image processing for racing)
 - Maybe add a lidar to the model and look at nav2? (SLAM stuff since this relates to what I have to do)


- CARLA
