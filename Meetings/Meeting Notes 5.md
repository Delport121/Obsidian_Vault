# Questions
## Ben
- The race track generator for pure pursuit does not work for the updated simulator. It does not find the minimum curve csv folder. Upon closer inspection it does not seem that there is such a folder in the directory at all.
- MPCC works but requires IPopt. This is mentioned in the readme, but the link takes you to Benjamin's repo.
- I am struggling to run the state estimation folder code. Its missing the file directory yet I am in the correct directory?
- WIll I be able to build and test my algorithms with the simulator (Especially in regards to the visualisation)
# What have I done:
- Work on modules (Had block modules last week)
- Pocket Cube stuff
- Spoke with Cyberate people a bit

# Plan for next week:
- Study state estimation theory
 - Do some research in regards to where there a gaps in the industry (Such as the fast image processing for racing)
 - Maybe add a lidar to the model and look at nav2? (SLAM stuff since this relates to what I have to do)
 - Look at slam (NB)
 - Setup latex template for note taking aspect of thesis

Slam for ros
