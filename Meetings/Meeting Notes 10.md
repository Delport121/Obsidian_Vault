# What have I done
- Finshed Ros course
- Finshed projects
- Plotted local maps for algorithm
- Read a thesis and found some thesis that seem closely related to what I have to do. I seem to at least be looking at the right things so far.

# Plans for next week

- [ ] Study  papers
	- [ ] Magic Formula tyre model
	- [ ] Common Road vehicle models
	- [ ] Model- and Acceleration-based Pursuit Controller for  
		High-Performance Autonomous Racing
	- [ ] https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1729881418755245

- [x] Particle filter rough implementation  [completion:: 2024-05-30]
- [x] Simulator visualisation of ben's stuff (real time) (Maybe)  [completion:: 2024-05-22]
- [x] Some further implementation of sensors on ros (I have the f1tenth repo, but I think it would be good to have my own vehicle with a lidar and camera)  [completion:: 2024-05-28]
- [ ] Study f1 tenth repo and ros repo (Specifically the particle filter)

# Year plan


21 May - 31 May
- Recap on simulator
- Rough implementations of Particle filter 
- Research on other localisation techniques and SLAM methods
- See if some other simulators can be executed (Voxel one and the rally one)

1 Jun - 30 Jun
- Rough implementations of Particle filter and localisation methods (EKF SLAM etc) (Python robotics)
 - Study f1tenth ros repo, (see if I can map the hallway with the stock particle filter)
 - Reimplement particle filter for F1tenth racing

1 Jul - 31 Jul
Expand racing with local maps into a localisation system that can be used to estimate a vehicle's location

1 Aug - 30 Aug
Test the localisation algorithm on the car

1 Sep - 30 Sep
- Expand local map racing into a SLAM algorithm that can fuse local maps together to form a race track.
- Start with writeup. One or two pages of lit review and maybe a bit of the body. (Very rough)

1 Oct - 31 Oct
Test algorithms on the F1Tenth platform

1 Nov - 30 Nov
Implement algorithms on a different robotic platform

1 Dec - 

Creat your own framework for the ros

Physical tests
